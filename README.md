3. TODO (not priority ordered)
   * [ ] Hide menu and give rhino window focus when a button is clicked (Run a command)
   * [ ] Make settings persistent to keep menu configuration between Rhino launches
   * [ ] Context menu to configure manually a button : Choose other icons, type in the Rhino command
     * This one will take long time and should be splitted in several sub tasks
   * [ ] Create Setting panel to choose shortcuts to launch radial menu
